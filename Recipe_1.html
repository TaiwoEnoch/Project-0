        <li><b>Combine the water, yeast, salt, and sugar.</b> Place all four ingredients in a small mixing bowl and stir gently to combine.
          Ideally, the water should be "blood temperature," or between 96 to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (35.5 to 37 degrees Celsius).
          Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes, or until the yeast fully dissolves and starts to foam.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Form a well with the flour.</b> Dump the flour out onto a clean, sturdy work surface and form it into a mound. Use your hands to alter the shape of this mound into a deep well with high walls.
          For this recipe, you'll knead the dough by hand. If you plan to use a stand mixer, however, you can place the flour into the bowl of the mixer instead of the table or counter.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Gradually combine the water and flour.</b> Add one-third of the water mixture. Use a fork to carefully knock some of the flour from the wall of the well into this puddle, but do not allow the well to collapse.
          After mixing the water into the flour, repeat this step with another one-third of the water, followed by the remaining third.
          When finished, a very sticky dough should form.</li>
        <li><b>Knead for 10 minutes.</b> Dust your hands with flour, then knead the dough by hand for 10 minutes. Stop only when the dough feels firm and cohesive.
          If you'd prefer to knead the dough using a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook attachment and work the dough on low to medium spread for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Place the dough in an oiled bowl.</b> Spread the olive oil over the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl. Place the dough inside, then turn it several times to coat the surface of the dough with oil.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Let the dough rise.</b> Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to sit in a warm spot for 60 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size.
          Ideally, the air temperature should be between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius).
          If you do not have a warm enough spot, heat the oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius). Turn off the preheated oven and give it several minutes to cool slightly, then allow the bowl of dough to rise inside.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Divide the dough.</b> Separate the risen dough into two halves. Roll each half into a ball.
          Place the balls of dough 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a lightly floured surface. When they expand enough to touch, they'll be ready to use or store.
          If you wish to save one or both rounds for another time, you can place the dough in an airtight container and freeze it for up to two weeks. Fully thaw frozen dough to room temperature before working with it, though.</li>
